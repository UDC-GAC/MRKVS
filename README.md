# Random vector packing generator

Automatic generation of intrinsics-like C code for any random packing
combination given a subset of instructions.

## Requirements

[Z3 SMT framework](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) is required. You can find
there the instructions for installing it and more documentation. For the Python
binding, you can install it (Debian-like systems) as follows:

```bash
pip install z3-solver
```
